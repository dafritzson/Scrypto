# Scrypto

**********************************************************************************************************************************************

Notes:
Requires Python 3.6+. Uses third party library xlsxwriter. Additional libraries may be needed if not already installed but can be found in the import section of the main program.

Main program is labeled Scrypto. The code in this script was written entirely by me. It does, however, utilize three public third party API wrappers for the cryptocurrency exchanges Binance, Bittrex, and Kucoin for the actual initialization of the API client and its subsequent REST API requests. 

All API keys, account information, and SMTP info have been removed for distribution purposes.

**Future improvements: OO design with abstraction from each exchange's individual API quirks so it can be easily expanded to more exchanges. Working on a sketch for this and should be uploaded soon. Creating a full redesign of the code will take more time though...**
